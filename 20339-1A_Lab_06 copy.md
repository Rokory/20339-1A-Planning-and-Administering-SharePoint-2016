# Module 6: Creating web applications and site collections
# Lab A: Creating and configuring web applications

## Scenario

The IT team at Contoso, Ltd. has created a server farm for the initial deployment of SharePoint 2016. The server farm consists of three servers: a domain controller, a SQL Server 2014 server with Service Pack 1 (SP1) environment, and a SharePoint 2016 server. The team has configured the SharePoint farm, including incoming and outgoing email and Office Web Apps Server integration. Your task is to create a new web application for team collaboration that allows self-service site creation, so teams can create their own sites with minimal administrative assistance. In addition, you will configure an outgoing email address for the new web application so that emails sent by the web application are easily identifiable from other emails sent by SharePoint.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a SharePoint 2016 web application.

* Configure SharePoint 2016 web application settings.

### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

## Exercise 1: Creating a web application

### Scenario

To create the team collaboration site, in this exercise, you create new web application by using the Central Administration site. Creating the new web application requires that you configure Domain Name System (DNS) and create service accounts on the domain controller.

You use the Central Administration site to register the service account as a SharePoint managed account. You then create the new web applications.

Finally, you disable loopback checking for the domains used by the new web applications to ensure that you can browse to the web applications on the SharePoint server.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure DNS for the new web application

2. Create service accounts for the web applications

3. Register new service accounts as SharePoint managed accounts

4. Create the web applications

5. Disable loopback checking for the required domains

#### Task 1: Configure DNS for the new web application

1. Sign in to the NYC-DC1 machine as **administrator@contoso.com** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

2. Open DNS manager.

3. Add a new host record to the contoso.com forward lookup zone with the following properties.

| Name       | *           |
| IP address | 172.16.1.21 |

#### Task 2: Create service accounts for the web applications

1. Start Active Directory Administrative Center.

2. Create a new user with the following details.

| Full name                   | Teams Web App Service Account |
| UPN logon                   | SPTeamsWebApp@contoso.com     |
| SAM Account Name logon      | contoso\SPTeamsWebApp         |
| Password                    | Pa$$w0rd                      |
| Password never expires      | Selected                      |
| User cannot change password | Selected                      |

#### Task 3: Register new service accounts as SharePoint managed accounts

* Use Central Administration to register the contoso\SPTeamsWebApp account that you created in the previous tasks as a managed account.

#### Task 4: Create the web applications

1. Create a new web application with the following properties.

| IIS web site name                 | SharePointTeams                                   |
| Port                              | 80                                                |
| Host header                       | teams.contoso.com                                 |
| Path                              | C:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\teams80 |
| Application pool name             | SharePointTeams                                   |
| Application pool security account | CONTOSO\SPTeamsWebApp                             |

2. In Internet Information Services (IIS), stop the **Default Web Site**.

3. Remove the host header from the bindings of the site **SharePoint - sharepoint.contoso.com80**.

#### Task 5: Disable loopback checking for the required domains

1. In the registry add **teams.contoso.com** and **projects.contoso.com** to the vlaue **BackConnectionHostNames** in the key **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\MSV1_0**.

2. Restart IIS.

> Result: After completing this exercise, you should have created a new web application on the SharePoint server. In addition, you should have created the necessary service account, and configured DNS, and then configured the SharePoint server to permit browsing custom domains on the SharePoint server.

## Exercise 2: Configuring a web application

##### Task 2: Configure the outgoing email address for the web applications

* Set the outgoing email address for the **teams.contoso.com** web application to **teams@mail.contoso.com**.

#### Task 3: Prepare for the next lab

* When you are finished with the lab, keep all of the virtual machines running. The virtual machines in their current state are required for the next lab.

> Result: After completing this exercise, you should have configured outgoing email settings and managed paths for a web application.

# Lab B: Creating and configuring site collections

## Scenario

The IT team at Contoso has created a server farm for an initial deployment of SharePoint Server 2016. The server farm consists of three servers: a domain controller, a SQL Server 2014 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) deployment, and a SharePoint 2016 server. Your team has installed SQL Server 2014 SP1, and SharePoint Server 2016. You have created a new web application for team collaboration. You defined a managed path named teams to enable team collaboration by using a different site collection for each team with an easy to read address, for example, teams.contoso.com/team/coughremedyRX. These team sites require a storage limit and now need to be set to delete after project completion. To avoid losing data, before the site is deleted, IT will archive the contents to a site in the web application upon request, so a site collection that contains its own database (for easy backup) is required. Finally, the IT team will try out the new Fast Site Collection Creation feature so that they can provision project site collections (projectsite#0) for internal projects quickly, thereby cutting down on the resources usually required for the site collection creation.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a top-level site collection by using Central Administration for the site creation link and instructions related to the team site collections.

* Create a team archive site collection that requires its own content database by using Windows PowerShell.

* Enable and use Fast Site Collection Creation.

### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Virtual Machine: **20339-1A-NYC-DC1-C**, **20339-1A-NYC-DB1-C**, **20339-1A-NYC-SP1-C**

User name: **administrator@contoso.com**

Password: **Pa$$w0rd**

## Exercise 1: Creating and configuring site collections

### Scenario

To deploy the new team sites, you will create new site collections. You will create a top-level site collection by using the Central Administration site.

You will then use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to create host-named site collections. In addition, you will create a site collection with multiple URLs, one for the internal use on the company intranet and one for external use on the company’s extranet.

Finally, you will test the site collections to verify that they have been provisioned correctly.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Use Central Administration to create a top-level site collection in the teams.contoso.com web application

2. Use Windows PowerShell to create a host-named site collection in the teams.contoso.com web application

3. Configure quota, site use, and deletion policy, and enable Self-Service Site Creation

4. Enable Self-Service Site Creation

5. Access the new site collections

#### Task 1: Use Central Administration to create a top-level site collection in the teams.contoso.com web application

` New-SPSite http://projects.contoso.com -HostHeaderWebApplication http://sharepoint.contoso.com -Name "Project Information" -OwnerAlias CONTOSO\Administrator -Template STS#0

#### Task 3: Configure quota, site use, and deletion policy, and enable Self-Service Site Creation

1. In Central Administration, create a new quota template, named Team site quota, with the following settings:

 * Max Site Storage - 1,000 MB

 * Warning Site Storage - 750 MB

2. Set the **Default Quota Template** for the **SharePointTeams** web application to the name of the new quota template, **Team site quota**.

3. Configure Site Use Confirmation and Deletion for the **http:/teams.contoso.com** web application with the following settings:

 * **Check for unused site collections and send notices: Frequency** – Weekly

 * **Run the Check at: Hour** – 12 am

 * **Delete the site collection after sending: Number of notices** – 24.

#### Task 4: Enable Self-Service Site Creation

1. Use Central Administration to configure Self-Service Site Creation with the following settings:

2. Add **Everyone** to the **Members** SharePoint group.

3. Add the Self service site creation link to the home page.

4. Sign in to the Team Information SharePoint site as **contoso\megan** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

5. Add a new team site with the name **Cough Remedy Rx** and the URL **coughremedyrx**.

> Result: After completing this exercise, you should have created site collections by using the Central Administration site, and created host-named site collections by using Windows PowerShell.

## Exercise 2: Creating site collections in new content databases

### Scenario

To avoid losing data when sites are deleted, in this exercise you will use Windows PowerShell to create new content database for archiving sites. You will then use Windows PowerShell to create new site collections that use the new content databases. You will then test the site collections to ensure they have been provisioned correctly.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Use Windows PowerShell to create new content databases

2. Use Windows PowerShell to create new site collections

#### Task 1: Use Windows PowerShell to create new content databases

* Use the **New-SPContentDatabase** cmdlet to create a new content database named **WSS_Content_TeamArchive**, associated with the **teams.contoso.com** web application.

`New-SPContentDatabase -Name WSS_Content_TeamArchive -WebApplication http://teams.contoso.com`

#### Task 2: Use Windows PowerShell to create new site collections

* Use the **New-SPSite** cmdlet to create a new site collection:

`New-SPSite -Url "http://teams.contoso.com/team/archive" -ContentDatabase WSS_Content_TeamArchive -Name "Team Archive" -OwnerAlias CONTOSO\Administrator -Template "STS#0"`

> Result: After completing this exercise, you should have used Windows PowerShell to create new content databases and new site collections that use the new content databases.

## Exercise 3: Using Fast Site Collection Creation

### Scenario
